                    </h3>
                    <p className="card-text">Quality is not just a process for us, but this is something 
                that we strive for, every time. We follow globally-accepted quality control practices
                 to ensure our clients receive precisely what they ordered. Our thorough inspection of
                  granite at every stage of manufacturing negates the chances of flaws in the final product.

At Regatta Granites India, we pay closer attention to all types of defects
 found in granite stone like fissures, broken edges, chipped edges, swirl marks, 
 repairs, etc. From doing size checks to surface inspection, we touch every aspect 
 of stone quality during our quality control procedure.</p>

                    <p className="card-text">The role of packaging in the granite industry is pivotal as
                 improperly packed granite can cause harm to granite products like broken tiles, 
                 damaged finish, chipped edges, etc. At Regatta Granites India, we take packaging 
                 very seriously and use sturdier, well- fumigated wooden crates that keep the consignment 
                 safe & secure during transit.

In addition, we use high-quality plastic sheets between the slabs that act as a cushion 
and keep the slabs safe while on their way to their destination. To know more about our 
packaging procedure.</p>

                    <p className="card-text">Shipping granite to another country or region is complex and 
                this is why we start planning for an order delivery right from the production stage.
                 We rely on a robust and effective shipping and transportation system which helps ensure
                  all the said consignment is delivered on time.

At Regatta Granites India, we believe that it is the punctuality of
 the consignment that keeps our clients happy and we are ready to go
  the extra mile to keep our promise. In addition, we ensure that the
   consignment remains safe & secure during the transit while adhering to delivery timelines.</p>
